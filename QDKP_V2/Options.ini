-- BOSSES
--  Here you can set the DKP to award the raid for a boss kill. DKP_10 are awarded for 10-men instances
--  and DKP_25 for 25 men. For coliseum, you can also specify the DKP for the HEROIC version.
--  USES LIBBABBLE-BOSS, so you don't need to traslate the instances or the bosses' name into your language.
--  Comes preloaded with all raid instances found WoW:WotLK (up to Coliseum).
--  This is just a template, with everyting set at 0. Edit the table according to your guild's policy.
--  You should first set the instances default, then alter the boss particular table.
-- PLEASE NOTE: To detect a boss' kill that is not in the QDKP2_Bosses table, you must have the addons
-- Deadly Boss Mod OR BigWigs.

------------------- BID/ROLL MANAGER --------------------

-- QDKP bid manager has been developed with flexibility in mind. This means that it can be tricky to set up, depending on your
-- guild needs. The bid manager will listen for a list of possible keywords in raid and wispers. When found, the player who
-- wrote that word will be added to the "Bid manager" list in the players roster.
-- The "Value" field is a custom value that can get several meanings. The mostcommon, it will just be the player's DKP bid amount.
-- You can configure QDKP to perform some further calculation using several variables. You can read some example in hereunder.
-- The following configuration is a basic template that will work on most of the cases.
-- Keywords that QDKP will listen to by default: "need", "greed", "bid", "all", "half", "min" and /roll.
-- If you have troubles adapting the bid manager to your guild's rules, feel free to mail me your needs at rb@belloli.net. I'll try to
-- set up the keywords for you.
--
-- ALL keywords are CaSe InSeNsItIvE

QDKP2_BidM_Keywords={
--{keywords="need,greed"},			  --basic keywords to be used in a loot council guild (no bids).
{keywords="$n,bid $n,need $n,os $n,$n os,$n ос,ос $n"},			--$n stands for any valid numeric value. this will catch bids.
--{keywords="half", value="$net/2"}, 		--The "value" keyword is used to tell QDKP how to calculate the "Value" field.
{keywords="all,max,all in",value="$net"}, 	--this is just the complementary of the previous keyword.
{keywords="min,minimum",value="$minbid"}, 	--this places the minimum bid. if your guild doesn't have a minimum bid, simply remove it

-- the following keywords are only examples to show what you can do with the parameters:

-- This keyword introduces the "dkp" parameter. The Value field is calculated as the percentage of the current bid versus the
-- net DKP amount. When the winner will be announced, though, the reported DKP will be the orginal bid.
-- {keywords="$n, bid $n, need $n", value="$n*100/$net", dkp="$n"},

-- The $mintowin is used for the bid system where a bid winner doesn't spend all the DKP he bet, but rather the minimum
-- DKP he needs to win. EG: playerA bids 100 DKP, playerB bids 50. playerA wins, but he only spends the strict amount of DKP to
-- win, in this case 51. use it in the DKP field. If only one rolls, then mintowin is the minimum bid.
-- {keywords="$n, bid $n, need $n", dkp = "$mintowin"},

-- You can use the "min" and "max" parameters to change the minimum/maximum bet a player can place. This lets you set up a
-- fixed step-up bid system where a player must increase the previous bet by a minimum amount (in this case, 5).
-- the variable $higherbid1 is replaced with the actual top bet.
-- {keywords="$n, bid $n, need $n", min="($higherbid1 or $minbid)+5"},
-- {keywords="bid", value="($higherbid1 or $minbid)+5"}, --this is to automatically place a highest+5 bid when someone whispers you "bid"

-- This keyword is an implementation of a random influenced loot system. The player's bid will be modified by a coefficent that is 1 if
-- the roll is 0 and tops 3 if the roll is 100. The reported dkp are set to the original player's bid.
-- {keywords="$n,bid $n,need $n" ,value="(1+$roll*2/100)*$n", dkp="$n"},

-- The "/roll" keyword will trigger a bid when someone rolls. Use it if all your guildmembers have to do to place a bid is to /roll.
-- in this example, we get the bid value adding the net DKP amount to the 1-100 roll. the winner is charged by half his DKP.
-- {keywords="/roll", value="$net+$roll", dkp="$net/2"}

-- This keyword shows a EP/GP like loot system. "Value" will return the ratio between Total and Spent DKP, as percentage.
-- Please keep in mind that the EP/GP system usually works with a fixed prices loot system. No bids.
-- The DKP field is 0 to block QDKP from using the calculated value as DKP amount.
-- {keywords="need, greed", value="$total*100/$spent", dkp="0"},

-- These keywords are an implementation of the Ni Karma-like bidding system, where a player can use his DKP to place a "karma" (improved)
-- roll for half of their DKP (if they have at least 50 dkp), a normal "need" roll for 5 dkp, or an offspec roll for free.
-- offspec values will be reported as negative numbers, so that the bidder with the highest value is the winner in any case.
-- It also show how to tell QDKP if a player is eligible to use a keyword with the "eligible" field.
-- Credits for this system go to Ashley Francois (Zafrina of Kul Tiras).
-- {keywords="karma,bonus", value="$roll+$net", dkp="$net/2", eligible="$net>=50"}, --this will prevend karma bidding if $net<50
-- {keywords="need,no bonus", value="$roll", dkp="5"}, --this keyword is not needed in a pure ni karma system, but can be useful.
-- {keywords="offspec", value="$roll-101", dkp="0"},
